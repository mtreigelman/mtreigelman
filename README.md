Hello, I’m Michael Reigelman | @mtreigelman

I am currently a Master's Student in Data Science at the University of San Francisco, and will be graduating the summer of 2022. 

In addition to the work I've done for school, I also have an interest in working on:  data visualizations, maps, ML & predition modeling, projects related to coding and music, sports analytics, and autonomous control systems. 

Tool used in my projects include: Python 3.0, PySpark, Unix, SciKitLearn, TensorFlow, and Postgres SQL.

Many of my projects from school are private; so if you are curious about any of the projects listed below, please feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtreigelman/) for more information.
